Today is April 14, 2025, and Borussia Dortmund and FC Barcelona have already faced each other in the first leg of this UEFA Champions League quarter-final tie. On the third match day, Barcelona faced Dortmund on April 9, 2025, winning the match 4-0 at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Barcelona. ​
The return leg is on April 15, 2025, at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. Barcelona has a 4-0 lead on aggregate, so Dortmund will need to overturn that deficit here to advance. ​
Crucial developments leading into the second leg:
Injuries: Central defender Nico Schlotterbeck will miss the rest of the season with a torn meniscus, a major blow to Borussia Dortmund’s back line. Barcelona's big loss has come in the form of a hamstring injury to Lewandowski's left-hand side partner Alejandro Balde that could keep the defender out for up to three weeks and sees him miss out on key matches including in the Champions League. ​
Suspension Worries: Barcelona’s Iñigo Martínez is one yellow card away from a ban that would rule him out of the semifinals. This may impact his playing time for the next game. ​
